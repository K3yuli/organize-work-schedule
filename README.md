# organize-work-schedule
This project strives to help users with their busy work schedule.  Users will be able to add important events to the planner from 8 AM to 7 PM so that users can manage their time effectively.

## Project Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
<br>
WHEN I open the planner
<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
<br>
WHEN I scroll down
<br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
<br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
<br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<br>
WHEN I click into a time block
<br>
THEN I can enter an event
<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
<br>
